     * 						enterprise level LDAP or some other Directory service 
     * 						sitting on top of the Service being created. As such, 
     * 						the request does not always need to have this within 
     * 						the payload. However, it is provided in case the 
     * 						Service implementers want to implement security on a 
     * 						more fine-grained and lower level.
     * 						<p/>
     * 						If indeed this is used, then the implementers must 
     * 						ensure that either this attribute is selectively 
     * 						encrypted within the payload, or sent over secure 
     * 						transport channel e.g. TLS, SSL, or HTTPS.

     * 						However, if the Request was for	a business process 
     * 						which takes a long term to complete, like Student 
     * 						Enrollment, the Service	Provider will send a generated 
     * 						value for the Correlation Identifier in this field 
     * 						(see Response.CorrelationIdentifier) as 
     * 						the immediate synchronous Response to the Student 
     * 						Enrollment Request. The Service	Consumer can then use 
     * 						this Correlation Identifier as a callback, in the future 
     * 						to correlate the original Student Enrollment Request to 
     * 						the eventual Response when received from the Service 
     * 						Provider, sent asynchronously.
